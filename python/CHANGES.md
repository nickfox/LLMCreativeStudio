# LLMCreativeStudio v0.9 - Enhanced Debate System with User Participation

## Enhanced Debate System with User Participation

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Active User Participation**
   - User now participates as the fourth voice in the debate alongside the three LLMs

2. **Revised Debate Flow**
   - Round 1: Opening statements from all participants (LLMs + user)
   - Round 2: Defense & Questions from all participants
   - Round 3: Responses & Final Positions from all participants
   - Round 4: Weighted Consensus with percentage allocations from all participants
   - Final: Synthesis incorporating all perspectives

3. **User Control Options**
   - Type a regular message to contribute to the current round
   - Use `/continue` to advance to the next round without adding input
   - Ability to redirect the debate if it goes off course

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Added user-specific debate states for each round
   - Implemented waiting mechanism between rounds
   - Added user input processing with natural language parsing for questions and consensus scores
   - Updated API responses to indicate when user input is required
