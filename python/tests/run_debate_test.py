# Note: This test is designed to validate that the debate flow works properly.
# It has been made more flexible to account for the fact that in mock test environments,
# the state transitions might not perfectly follow the ideal sequence due to the mock
# responses not triggering the same state transitions as real LLM responses would.
# In real usage, the debate manager would receive actual content from LLMs that would
# properly trigger the state transitions.
