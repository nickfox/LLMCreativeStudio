main.py is the first iteration multi-llm chat with Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-02-05

lmm-creative-studio.txt is the long chat with gemini 2.0 flash thinking experimental model detailing the requirements for llm creative studio
https://gemini.google.com/app/0980fb4c8f7b5a2c

discussion of architecture and tools

first off, i will always be using macs to run the software we will create. i prefer desktop applications to command line or web apps. I wanted to start off the conversation by deciding what tools we would be using. xcode and swift which would allow us to create a beautiful app and access to all things mac. google AI studio? Python, langchain and other tools which would allow us to take advantage of existing AI integration frameworks. a hybrid of these two, or perhaps something entirely different that you could recommnend. 

i am open to all suggestions and to be very clear, i'm not tied down to any language, programming environment or framework. you see from my initital conversation i had earlier today with gemini where i'm going with this and what i hope to accomplish.

please advise.

*******************

first off, your plan sounds excellent. and here are a few things that will help me: 

1. every file that we write together should have a comment at the top of the file with the full path and file name

ie.
# /Users/nickfox137/Documents/llm-creative-studio/example.swift
# /Users/nickfox137/Documents/llm-creative-studio/example.py

this is immensely helpful and this is the actual root directory for the project:

/Users/nickfox137/Documents/llm-creative-studio/

and the top level directory structure

llm-creative-studio/
├── swift/
└── python/

the python directory will have the venv and python code, feel free to suggest an upper level directory structure for other things
like langchain, etc.

2. please include all imports when writing files. (for some reason deepseek felt import statements were not necessary...)

3. when giving me code files or updates, plese just give me the entire file instead of code snippets. (i am 64 and prefer not to hunt and peck through code files)

4. if we are starting off by continuing work on main.py, could you please include code for claude. these will be our three LLMs:

gemini, chatgpt and claude.

5. "Swift, Storyboard or SwiftUI – your preference, but Storyboard might be easier if you're more familiar with older Xcode"

i have no interest at all in backwards compatibility. i think swiftUI would be the best going forward.

AIs in the chat need to ask clarifying questions and challenge other AIs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


is RAG appropriate now with small chunking? is it needed?

would sqlite or another store be better for better accuracy. since i will not have lots of data, is there something that takes entire pdfs or pdf broken up by chapter?clear

******************

LLMCreativeStudio is the app name

com.websmithing.LLMCreativeStudio is the bundle indentifier

need more error handling and logging in the swift code

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


i've broken out the app into other files and everything is working correctly. i've also put the application under version control. its on github in a private repo called "LLMCreativeStudio". at the end of each iteration can you please give me the command (from my mac terminal) to push the latest iteration and also, why don't we call each iteration by a number. ie, 0.1, 0.2. 0.3 etc. i'm not sure what iteration we are on but, let's start numbering them so that we can refer back easily to a past iteration. Please figure out what number iteration we are on and let me know the number.

within the chat app, please remove the 3 buttons from the app (gemini, chatgpt, claude) and instead, i would like to "send" to one of the AIs when i mention them by name in my chat text. their names are below preceeded by the @ sign. (ie, Nick -> "could i get a summary of that, @g", "hey @o, can you please check the web for me.")

sending a message without an @ indicator means that i am sending a message to all users.
@q = query backend data (pdfs, "@q, what do you think of the agentic reasoning paper?")
@a and @claude = send to claude
@c and @chatgpt = send to chatgpt
@g and @gemini = send to gemini

no buttons at all. we can put any required functionality in the app menus.

textbox goes all the way across the app with padding, and the text box should be 3 lines high. in the textbox, if i press enter then please send. if i press shift-enter, then just go down to the next line.

here is the challenge now, i would prefer if we just used sqlite instead of a json file. i've been using sqlite since about 2000 and i think it's a more robust, and professional way to handle this. plus i like it. also, let gets langchain involved, it think that help with some of the upcoming functionality. if you think it's a good idea to break these up into two iterations instead of one, let me know. but i think this is a good direction, let me know if you agree. take advantage of all of langchain's abilities. currently we are storing keywords for retrieval. is that the best way in a semantic world?

i want to be able to drag and drop a pdf on to the app chat window, doing that then causes this:

a. create a new nick message bubble, always give the title of document ("Agentic Reasoning: Reasoning LLMs with Tools for the Deep Research") if applicable, and also the actual name of the file ("agentic-reasoning.pdf"), if it's a paper from a scientic journal, give the abstract and conclusion also directly from the paper.
b. send the pdf to the 3 llms for analysis, summary and own conclusion (not the conclusion in the paper, your own opinion), relevant keywords, section titles if applicable, this will be used to create a record in sqlite for later retrieval, and all other information that you need about the document.
c. puts the pdf into the libary directory (make sure watchdog is running as we discussed above in "library" directory)
d. each llm just gives summary and own conclusion in chat window
e. put the record into sqlite

when all the summaries/conclusions have arrived, then we will begin a "chat with PDF" session. i want each to ask questions. ask clarifying questions to me and to the other LLMs. answer questions in a natural round-robin way, and if llm started with or was assigned a task or persona, make sure that questions pertaining to that AI is relevant. and if a question is asked, the AI to whom the question is most relevant should answer. Make observations, provide alternative views. discuss the ideas within the pdf and the conclusions. discuss the plausibility of the conclusion and the experiment. things like that, please provide more ideas. i want this to be very much like 4 people sitting together and discussing a pdf, a research paper for instance. make it feel natural with good flow of discussion.

i'm sure chatting with PDFs has been well documented somewhere. i'm attaching the first pdf (agentic-reasoning.pdf), i would like you to analyze it summarize for me, please. this will be the pdf i drop onto the application chat window. this is a very new paper, is there anything in there that would make you want to change your architecture? lets discuss this and please advise.

You are an expert at designing software. You have been given a task to design a chat application where three different LLMs from three different companies are all members within the same chat discussion. Consider using langchain/langgraph or microsoft autogen for this. the current design uses a swiftUI desktop app for the front end chat app and a python backend. this could all be placed in docker for more security. the most important thing is this needs to feel like a natural discussion between several people sitting around a table discussing or debating an idea.

the logic i have so far is this. when i am chatting in the chat app, if i include @a, @c or @g in my message, it means i am directing my response to @a = claude, @c = chatgpt, a@ = gemini. ie "hey @g, what do you think of @c's response?" or "@a, could you do a web search for me on something" or "could you please summarize the paper, "agentic reasoning" in our local store, @a"

if i do not include the the @ designator then the message is for everyone. if you can think of a better way to make this more natural, (sitting around a table and having a debate with others) then please let me know.

here are a few things to consider:

- turn taking logic
- orchestrates message sending and receiving betwee and LLMs and user (me)
- managing conversation state and history
- and whatever else you decide needs to be done

Here are three use cases of what this multi-LLM chat needs to be able to do.

1. help write scientific research papers. You need to be able to do research online (ie, arxiv, google scholar, etc) and also access locally stored research papers (in pdf form) and interogate them. The three LLMs must be able to have debates on whatever topic or thought experiment is presented in the chat. The debates must seem like a real debate between people. i would like to tell the LLMs to debate with themselves for 3 rounds and then reach a conclusion from that round of debates. and then continue the debate or discussion.

2. help write songs. this needs to include roleplaying with famous artists like lennon and mccartney. each LLM will represent a different artist. in additoin to just roleplaying, suggest other things that would help in the songwriting process

3. help write a book, once again including roleplaying with a famous writer. an LLM will represent the writer or writers. once again, suggest other things in addition to just roleplaying.




all files must have full path of file as a comment on first line of file. is.
