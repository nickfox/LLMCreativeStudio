within the chat app, please remove the 3 buttons from the app (gemini, chatgpt, claude) and instead, i would like to "send" to one of the AIs when i mention them by name in my chat text. their names are below preceeded by the @ sign. (ie, Nick -> "could i get a summary of that, @g", "hey @o, can you please check the web for me.")

sending a message without an @ sign means that i am sending a message to all users.
@q = query backend data (pdfs, "@q, what do you think of the agentic reasoning paper?")
@a and @claude = send to claude
@c and @chatgpt = send to chatgpt
@g and @gemini = send to gemini

no buttons at all. we can put any required functionality in the app menus.

i want to create a simple dark color scheme. i also want the app to look dead simple. no buttons. everything left justified. the users will be me and three AIs (claude, chatgpt and gemini). there will be one textbox at the bottom that goes across the entire length of the app. the text box will grow in size automatically as i reach the end of the textbox or hit shift-enter. i will use enter to send the text.

i want the background to be something very dark, not quite black, but a pleasing "off-black" or dark charcoal. i want every everyone's text to be in a text "area" or bubble (with only slightly rounded corners) that goes across the entire app (with padding). this text bubble will simply be a color that is less dark to the background but is complementary to the color. the text can be white or something slightly off-white. once again complementary to the entire color scheme. finally just above the text bubble to the left will be the name of the person or AI who wrote that message. I would like this to be in a light magenta and smaller text than in the text bubble. i want it to be tasteful. i want the entire app to be tasteful and very color coordinated. can you please help me with this?

I'll help you create a refined, minimalist color scheme for your SwiftUI chat app. I'll suggest a carefully coordinated set of colors that work well together while maintaining readability and elegance.

Here's a color palette that should achieve what you're looking for:

swift

extension Color {
    static let background = Color(hex: "1A1A1D")     // Rich dark charcoal
    static let messageBubble = Color(hex: "2C2C30")  // Slightly lighter charcoal
    static let messageText = Color(hex: "F5F5F5")    // Soft white
    static let senderName = Color(hex: "E065BA")     // Muted magenta
}

// Hex color helper
extension Color {
    init(hex: String) {
        let hex = hex.trimmingCharacters(in: CharacterSet.alphanumerics.inverted)
        var int: UInt64 = 0
        Scanner(string: hex).scanHexInt64(&int)
        let a, r, g, b: UInt64
        switch hex.count {
        case 3:
            (a, r, g, b) = (255, (int >> 8) * 17, (int >> 4 & 0xF) * 17, (int & 0xF) * 17)
        case 6:
            (a, r, g, b) = (255, int >> 16, int >> 8 & 0xFF, int & 0xFF)
        case 8:
            (a, r, g, b) = (int >> 24, int >> 16 & 0xFF, int >> 8 & 0xFF, int & 0xFF)
        default:
            (a, r, g, b) = (255, 0, 0, 0)
        }
        self.init(
            .sRGB,
            red: Double(r) / 255,
            green: Double(g) / 255,
            blue: Double(b) / 255,
            opacity: Double(a) / 255
        )
    }
}

For the message bubbles, you might want something like this:

swift

struct MessageBubble: View {
    let message: Message
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 4) {
            Text(message.senderName)
                .font(.system(size: 13))
                .foregroundColor(.senderName)
                .padding(.horizontal, 16)
            
            Text(message.content)
                .foregroundColor(.messageText)
                .padding(16)
                .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
                .background(Color.messageBubble)
        }
    }
}

For the growing text input:

swift

struct GrowingTextInput: View {
    @Binding var text: String
    let onSubmit: () -> Void
    
    var body: some View {
        TextEditor(text: $text)
            .frame(maxHeight: 120)
            .padding(12)
            .background(Color.messageBubble)
            .foregroundColor(.messageText)
            .onKeyPress(.return) { press in
                if !press.modifiers.contains(.shift) {
                    onSubmit()
                    return .handled
                }
                return .ignored
            }
    }
}

The colors I've chosen create a sophisticated, dark theme:

    The background (1A1A1D) is a rich charcoal that's easier on the eyes than pure black
    The message bubbles (2C2C30) provide subtle contrast against the background
    The text color (F5F5F5) is slightly off-white for better readability
    The sender name color (E065BA) is a muted magenta that adds a touch of personality without being overwhelming

Would you like me to adjust any of these colors or show you how to implement specific parts of the interface?
