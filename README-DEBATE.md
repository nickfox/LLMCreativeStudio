# LLMCreativeStudio Debate System

## User Participation in Debates

The enhanced debate system now allows you to participate as an active debater alongside the LLMs, creating a truly collaborative discussion environment.

### How It Works

1. **Starting a Debate**
   
   To start a debate, type:
   ```
   /debate [your topic]
   ```
   Example: `/debate The ethics of AI in creative industries`

2. **Debate Rounds with User Participation**

   - **Round 1: Opening Statements**
     - Each LLM provides their initial perspective
     - You'll be prompted for your opening statement
     - Type your thoughts or use `/continue` to skip
     
   - **Round 2: Defense & Questions**
     - Each LLM defends their position and asks questions of others
     - You'll be prompted to add your defense and questions
     - Direct questions to specific participants using their names
     
   - **Round 3: Responses & Final Positions**
     - Each LLM responds to questions and refines their stance
     - You'll be prompted to respond to questions asked of you
     - Add your final position on the topic
     
   - **Round 4: Weighted Consensus**
     - Each LLM allocates percentage points across positions
     - You'll be prompted to add your own allocations
     - All allocations should total to 100%
     
   - **Final: Synthesis**
     - A final synthesis is generated incorporating all perspectives
     - The synthesis weighs positions based on consensus scores

3. **Your Options at Each Step**

   When it's your turn to contribute, you have two options:
   
   - **Add your input**: Type your thoughts, questions, or allocations
   - **Skip your input**: Type `/continue` or use the "Continue" button
   
   Your input will be incorporated into the debate just like any other participant's.

### UI Indicators

- **Debate Status Indicator**: Shows the current debate round and state
- **Waiting for Input Banner**: Appears when it's your turn to contribute
- **Round Labels**: Messages show which debate round they belong to
- **Input Prompt**: Highlights when user input is expected
- **Selectable Text**: All debate text can be selected and copied

### Tips for Effective Participation

- **Be specific with questions**: Direct clear questions to specific LLMs or characters
- **Reference previous points**: Acknowledge strong arguments from others
- **Stay on topic**: Keep contributions focused on the debate topic
- **Add unique perspectives**: Your human viewpoint adds valuable diversity

### Example Debate Commands

- `/debate Is AI art real art?`
- `/debate Should social media be regulated?`
- `/debate What's the future of remote work?`
- `/continue` (to skip your input for a round)

The new debate system creates a more natural, engaging, and educational experience by making you an active participant rather than just an observer.
